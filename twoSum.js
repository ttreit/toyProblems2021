//  Notes
  //  Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
  //  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
  //  You can return the answer in any order.

  //Inputs: array of integers, target
  //Output: indices of the two numbers that add up to the target
  //Constraints:  assume each input would have exactly one solution, may not use same element twice
  //Edge Cases:   Empty array, Zero, Negative Numbers

  //  Purpose of calling this function
    // Find the two numbers in an array that add to the target number

  //

// Solution
